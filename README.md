# README: Python Mini-Projects  

### Overview  
This repository contains three Python mini-projects showcasing fundamental programming concepts and creative implementations:  
1. **Snake Game**  
2. **Tic Tac Toe Game**  
3. **Digital Clock**
4. **Sudoku Validator** 

Each project demonstrates problem-solving skills, Python libraries, and user-friendly interfaces.

### Projects  

#### 1. Snake Game  
A modern recreation of the classic arcade game where a snake grows as it consumes food, avoiding collisions with walls and itself.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Dynamic gameplay with growing snake mechanics.  
  - Collision detection and game-over logic.  
  - Real-time movement using libraries like **Pygame** or **Tkinter**.  
- **How to Run**:  
  Run the script in your Python environment and control the snake using keyboard inputs.  

#### 2. Tic Tac Toe Game  
A two-player turn-based game implemented in Python. Players alternate turns marking Xs and Os to form a straight line on a 3x3 grid.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Validates player moves and detects winning or draw conditions.  
  - Includes an optional computer AI opponent for single-player mode.  
  - Supports both text-based and graphical interfaces.  
- **How to Run**:  
  Run the script, and follow on-screen instructions to play the game.  

#### 3. Digital Clock  
A real-time digital clock application displaying the current time in a simple and elegant GUI.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Dynamically updates the current time using the `time` module.  
  - Customizable interface with fonts, colors, and design using **Tkinter**.  
  - Additional features (optional): alarm and time zone adjustments.  
- **How to Run**:  
  Run the script to display a live clock in a GUI window.

#### 4. Sudoku Validator  
The **Sudoku Validator** is a Python-based tool to check the validity of a 9x9 Sudoku board, ensuring it follows all standard rules.  
- **Features**:  
  - Detects duplicates in rows, columns, and sub-grids.  
  - Handles empty cells seamlessly for incomplete boards.  
  - Simple and efficient logic for fast validation.  
- **Technologies Used**: Core Python with logical operations.  
- **How to Run**:  
  Input a 9x9 board (list of lists) into the `isValidSudoku` method and receive a `True` or `False` result for validity.  

### Requirements  
- Python 3.9+  
- Additional Libraries (if needed):  
  - **Pygame**: `pip install pygame`  
  - **Tkinter**: Pre-installed in Python
